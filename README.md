# Groundrim (Legacy)
Quick bash game i ported from my old windows batch project, **but it's still not complete!**
## Building
Since this is written in bash, you can't really build it
## Running the game
If you have the most basic knowledge of linux you whould know how to run it:
```
chmod +x ./groundrim.sh
bash ./groundrim.sh
```
